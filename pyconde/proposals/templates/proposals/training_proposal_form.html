A training is not a lecture. A training is more a hands-on workshop where
participants get the opportunity to do something on their own laptop, following the lead of a 
coach. You should keep in mind that exercises that you can solve in a few minutes 
often take 5 to 10 times longer for beginners, since they need to learn the basic steps first.

Participants should receive courseware as either PDF or printed material. This
should be as detailed as necessary for a participant to understand the training content
independently.
